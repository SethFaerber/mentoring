# Dev I Meetings

Connect to discuss and document the future of Dev1

## What’s the vision? 
 - Hello Friends, 
Welcome to the Dev1 meetings. Our mission is to create a pressure-free learning space for all dev1s to come and share their knowledge, build their public speaking skill, and create valuable relationships with fellow software engineers. We are always trying to make this meeting more valuable, so please feel free to suggest ways we can make it better. After all this meeting is for us! Moving forward, we will incorporate more things like lighting talk, guest speakers and other cool ideas. Currently, the usual structure is
- Ice Breaker
- Word of the week
- Demos
We always love to see you there! Feel free to forward the meeting for a dev1 who might be interested. The last meeting series ended, and I am sending a new one that goes up to Dec. I tried to include everyone, but if I missed anyone, please extend the invite. Thank you :)

 - A place to say stupid things 
 - Fosters a healthy shame in everyone "Voice of the Heart" by Chip Dodd book. Healthy shame is the beginning of risk-taking.
   - A place to not put up a front. Not have to hide that you're ignorant.

## What has worked?
 - The three staples above
 - Advent of Code was really great.
 - Beza had a good structure to the meetings
 - Co-leader Josh Sikes and Dalton Zebric
 - Keeping it grassroots and democratic contribution. Everyone shares is better than a presenter presents one thing the whole time.

## What has not worked?
 - Hasn't been very structured recently.
 - Not using the Teams channel...there's not a lot of visibility.

## Ideas to make it better?
 - Q&A with upper dude
 - Dev I / Dev II mixer
 - Keeping people up to date in everyone's mind.
 - Changing date if we investigate and find Friday is a conflict.
 - Accountability
 - Sharing goals with each other
 - Talking about our frustrations so you don't feel alone.

## How to find new Dev1’s?
 - Word of mouth
 - Investment Fund

## Favorite memories?
 - Brady and Holly get promotions. Memes, treats, balloons.
 - Breaking the silos --- our problems are not unique. Gaining context with people from other business units.

## Wave the Magic Wand
 - Make it mandatory!
   - Prod Eng Monthly is mandatory and it is clear.
   - If it was part of people's routine, it would help us to put more pressure to make it excellent. Accountability for leadership to do a great job with it.

## Activity Ideas
- Lean Coffee: Sticky note topics, dot vote, Kanban: Topics / Discuss / Done

## Josh's Findings
- Dev1 was a place for JumpSeat to be less homeless while they jumped between squads.
- Dev1 
- The more experience they get, the less they come for support.
- 
- Lots of meetings on Fridays
- "Meeting became a hard thing to justify with everything else going on."
- Conclusion: If we hire more Dev1's, this should be an almost required community. However, they are gaining more experience and Dev1 is a lot like Chapter Meetings.

## Moving Forward
- Friday is the last Friday for Ryan and Fridays
- Wednesday, connect with Investment Fund.
- "Plan on Thursdays" time TBD.
- Small but useful! Dev1 - It's about us.
