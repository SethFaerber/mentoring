# Weekly Learning
This documents the main things I learned this week.
- "Confidence" means that I moved into a deeper understanding and consistent implementation in an area.
- "Awareness" means I have an understanding of this topic, but am not fully practiced in it.


## Current Week: October 2nd - 6th
- EveryDollar
  - Awareness of E$'s startup flow, how the signletons are initialized, and the order that clients are setup. Some cool patterns in there.
- OOP
  - In Ruby, attr_readers are about encapsulation. I didn't realize that its essentially wrapping the variable in a method.
  - Circular dependency is ugly. Not sure exactly how to fix it yet.
- Workflow
  - I really broke my rule and tried to quickly do something without understanding it first...trying to implement the client built
  without taking the time to figure out how the other clients are implemented. I should have taken the time to understand how they are 
  implemented, and then sit down with my mentor to discuss different approaches to get a quick win out of it.

## September 25-29
- C#
  - Constructor overloading: Set up multiple constructors for a class, each with different parameters. When you instantiate it, pick which parameters
  to pass, and it will instantiate with the correct constructor. A use-case for this is returning an object from a network call.
  The call might result in a successful response or an error. You can set up two constructors, for for success and one for error.
  - Partial Classes: Class definition is broken up into multiple files. Good for separating concerns.
- Confidence: Client Setup in EveryDollar ([GitHub design doc](https://github.com/lampo/ramsey-plus-budget-app/issues/2713))
  - [`dotnet-apiclient-base`](https://github.com/lampo/dotnet-apiclient-base/blob/master/README.md) is a library we use to shape up the HTTP requests and responses to/from APIs.
  - Client: `BabyStepClient` [Design Doc for this Feature](https://github.com/lampo/ramsey-plus-budget-app/issues/2737)
    - üó£Ô∏è Builds the request using the `ApiClient` library. Creates at Task then implements `HttpRequestMessage` builder. Returns result using `result.ToResult()`.
    - ‚ùì Why does my intellisense not pick up `SendAsyc` and `ToResultAsync` from `ApiClient.Core`??? 
    **I hadn't defined the other partial for that class which inherits from `ApiClient`**
  - Interface: `IBabyStepClient`
    - üó£Ô∏è Simply mandates that the Client is created with the HTTP request method which takes `CorrelationVector` and `CancellationToken` as parameters. üñäÔ∏è The `UserFinalizeClient` takes in an Auth0Token and passes it the the URI ~which is what I need to do for UserProfileBasic.~ **Actually, I just need AXID, not auth token**
  - Shared: `BabyStepClient.shared` ???
    - üó£Ô∏è This defines the other part of the `partial UserProfileBasicClient` class using the `ApiClient` helper methods. Seems like I need to use:
      - `BabyStepConfig` from my class
      - `IRetryPolicy` from `ApiClient` to attempt calls again if there are errors.
      - `IApiClientLogger` from `ApiClient`. Not sure what this does
      - `IUserAgentAttributesProvider` from `ApiClient`. Not sure what this does
      - `HttpMessageHandler` from `IDisposeable`.
      - `Func<string> jwtTokenProvider` not sure if this is needed, but it may be used to get through to a service that requires authorization.
  - Result: `UserProfileBasicResult`
    - üó£Ô∏è Creates a Result object using constructor overloading which holds the success, status code, and data returned. ‚ùì Not sure how this is called or whether the resulting object is used as the primary data source.
  - Config: `BabyStepConfig`
    - üó£Ô∏è A standardized configuration for setting hostname, port, default timeout properties.
- Learning Process
  - When churning, pick up a pen and write something or draw something. I think of it like checking the map of the problem.
    - Write down where you are, where you've been, and where you want to go.
    - Where you are: Write down what you know.
    - Where you've been: Write down what you've learned so far'.
    - Where you want to go: Write down the minimum requirements to get what you need or all questions you have about that place.

## September 18-22
- Removing Blockers
  - Given I am generically blocked...
    - Check low-level (typos, parameters, imports, logic)
    - Check mid-level (error logs, patterns, dependencies)
      - Look for info outside my IDE (docs, google, ChatGPT)
    - Reassess what I know and what questions I have (diagram, write, take a walk)
    - Explain the problem to a peer to get insight (not an answer) from a peer.
    - Learn what I need to learn to solve the problem.

## September 11-15
- Database
  - My db still needed the viewmodel as the go-between. In fact, I didn't really have to do much refactoring
  of the viewmodel at all. I just had to do a db call when newing up the Items object in the viewmodel.
  - The database may not be writing to disc which is why it looks like it loses data after rerunning the app after closing.
  - Found it! 

In the View:
```csharp
        private void AddItemToInventory(int selectedOptionIndex)
        {
            if (selectedOptionIndex > 0)
            {
                Item selectedItem = this.viewModel.Items.FirstOrDefault(item => item.Id == selectedOptionIndex);
                
                selectedItem.Status = Item.ItemStatus.Obtained;
                
                ItemsViewModel.UpdateItem(selectedItem);
            }
        }
```
In the ViewModel:
```csharp
        public async Task UpdateItem(Item item)
        {
            await Database.UpdateItem(item);
        }
```
In the `Database.cs` file:
```csharp
        public static async Task UpdateItem(Item item)
        {
            await InitializeDb();
            
            await dbConnection.UpdateAsync(item);
        }
```

## September 4-8
- Database
  - async will look for await and run them even if they are in an assignment statement.
    - `var id = await db.InsertAsync(briefcase);` the method will go to assign id, but runs into the `await`, so it runs the `await`, then comes back and finishes the assignment. So the 
  - Theres a real gap between my concept and the implementation in Xamarin. It's really convoluted compared to Javascript/React.
  - I'm also not able to take the basic implementation and turn it into something more complex yet.

## Aug 28 - Sept 1
- Database in XF app
  - Installing SQLite in project ~~SQLite.Net-PCL is compatible with Xamarin.iOS.~~ Nope. Needed `sqlite-net-pcl` instead.
  - Surprisingly, initializing the database on app load is smart. It will only initialize once, then ignore subsequent initializations (which would wipe the previous state of the database).
  - `Path.Combine` is a simple way to build a platform-agnostic path to the database.
  - `DependencyService.Get<ISQLite>()` is a way to build platform-specific paths to the database.
  - Dont install deprecated database packages. üòé
  - Not sure how to reference the database which is pretty perplexing.
- C#
  - Awareness: "interface" is like an archetype for a clas. It has "contracts" which are public methods and properties that must be implemented by any class which implements the interface.
  - Awareness: "contract" is a public method or property which must be implemented by any class which implements the interface. It's called a contract because it is a hard and fast rule which must be carried out for the class to be valid.
  - Confidence: Build a simple Interface.
- Xamarin.Forms
  - SafeArea is set on the page, not on a view... Component lifecycle makes this sticky.
  - Since SafeArea cannot be set on a view, I had the idea to read the dimensions of the SafeArea and pass it along to set the padding of the video to make it full screen.
  - With a CDN setup, we are serving our pages as HTML delivered from the database. Xamarin does not like to render images from URLs delivered by HTML. Need a workaround.
  

## August 21-25
- C#
  - Confidence: Creating a new page and wiring it up to a button click.
  - Confidence: Creating a new modal and wiring it up to a button click.
  - Confidence: Creating a new ViewModel and wiring it up to a page.
  - Confidence: Creating a new View and wiring it up to a ViewModel.
- Teamwork
  - Confidence: Break down problems in their essential and accidental complexity.
  - Awareness: Team cohesion and morale is just as important as the "What" concerns.
  - Awareness: Nailing down the language and terminology is incredibly important, but easy to overlook. I need to drive for clarity on language more.

## August 14-18
- Indexing Files 
  - You have to index files in the IDE if you drag/drop them into the folder manually.
- Xamarin
  - Confidence: Creating Click Events which lead to new pages and modals.
  - Confidence: turning on/off navigation bar and tab bar in the Shell.
  - Confidence: Connecting a ViewModel to a View with a BindingContext (supplied in the code behind).
  - Confidence: Various UI controls and their properties (Entry, Label, Button, Picker, Modal, etc.)

## August 7-11
- C
  - Learned how to build/compile in C. My key takeaways are in /c/c-learning.md
- Java
  - IntelliJ IDEA automatically sets up Maven.
  - Java reminds me of NodeJS.
- Postman
  - Sometimes you need an M2M token to access an endpoint. This is because the endpoint expects a machine like the BFF to access it
  rather than a user.
- every-dollar-mobile-bff
- ramsey-plus-smartmoney-api
  - an api which utilizes a database.
  - run a local database by running `docker-compose up` in the root directory. (Make sure Rancher is running first).
  - then run the api by hitting the debug button in IntelliJ.
  - In Postman
    - Generate a M2M (machine to machine) token.
    - Use that toke in the Authorization > Bearer Token field.
    - test the `/actuator/health` endpoint at `http://localhost:8080/ramsey-plus-smartmoney-api/actuator/health`
    - test the `/ready` endpoint at `http://localhost:8080/ramsey-plus-smartmoney-api/ready`

## July 31-August 4
- E$Mobile integration
  - E$Mobile does not use `<ControlTemplate>` which is really unfortunate. We use that in our testflight app everywhere.
  Essentially, it means we have to build custom `controls` instead of relying on Xamarin's built-in controls for everything.
  - E$Mobile's startup flow is UUUUUUUUGLY XD
    - It is a giant switch case statement with a bunch of `if` statements inside of it. It runs a page, the page
    sets itself complete at the end, then runs thru the switch statement again. And so on.
- Optimizely
  - You can only use a flag name once...so make it REALLY specific.
- Speak up!
  - Problems I see are mostly shared problems at this point.
- C#
  - Variable declarations in switch/case statements are scoped to the entire switch statement
    "magically" unless it is enclosed in a block.
```csharp
//Scoping to the entire switch statement

switch (someVariable)
{
    case 1:
        int x = 1;
        break;
    case 2:
        x = 2; // This looks up the declaration of x in case 1
        break;
}

// Narrowing the scope

switch (someVariable)
{
    case 1:
    {
    int x = 1;
    }
        break;
    case 2:
        x = 2; // This will break because x was scoped to case 1 only using a block
        break;
}
```

## July 24-28
- Over All Learning
  - Able to wire up a brand new View, Code Behind, and ViewModel in Xamarin.
  - Able to grasp 100% of View Layer in production code.
  - Able to grasp 85% of Code Behind in production code.
  - Able to conceptually grasp 90% of ViewModel in production code, and 50% of its detailed implementation (without diagrams).
    - *Recognizing that this ViewModel layer needs a diagram was a big win for me. I think it shows where I'm recognizing genuine complexity and identifying tools which can bring clarity*
- Xamarin
  - `AbsoluteLayout` was useful in centering an item between other elements without having to use a grid.
    ```xamarin
    <AbsoluteLayout VerticalOptions="FillAndExpand">
        <ffImageLoading:SvgCachedImage
            AbsoluteLayout.LayoutBounds="0.5, 0.5, 229, 229"
            AbsoluteLayout.LayoutFlags="PositionProportional"
            Source="resource://RamseyPlusApp.Resources.Images.bank-search.svg" />
    </AbsoluteLayout> 
    ```
  - `LayoutBountds` is "horizontalPositionPercentage, verticalPositionPercentage, horizontalSize, verticalSize"
- Ruby vs C#
  - Rails:
  ```ruby
  x = y = z = "howdy"
  
  puts x
  
  # => "howdy"
  ```
  - C#:
  ```csharp
  string x;
  string y;
  string z;
  
  x = y = z = "Howdy";
  
  Console.WriteLine(x);
  
  // => "howdy"
  ```
## July 17-21
- RamseyInHouse
  - I got a JavaScript project pulled down to improve and work on documentation next week.
  - I learned that Node Modules generally won't run on a local server without Webpack.
- Design
  - Don't make direct changes to your Model from the View layer!

## July 10-14
- C#
  - nullable returns from methods or variables is possible if the type declaration is
  appended with a question mark. This allows the return to be `null` whereas c sharp typically
  defaults to non-nullable types.
  ```csharp
  public string? UserName(name)
  {
  return name
  } 
  ```
  in this case, if the user never enters a name, the method will still return, but it will return `null`
instead of an error.
- Debugging
  - Steps to figure out where a bug came from (login failed)
  - Using breakpoints in IDE to pause code and step through it line by line to see where the error happens.
- 

## July 3-7
- Tech Design (two instances)
  - Helped determine the right path forward.

## June 26 - 30

- Full Stack
  - Seed Rails database with `has_and_belongs_to_many` association.
  - `<select>` to grab a particular item out of a database
  - render that item in a partial.

*Accelerated Learning Methods*
1. Working Ramsey my pace (solo, pair as needed) 
2. Make a problem to work on (personal project, patterns)
3. Hackerrank
4. Teach / Present

*Slower Pace*
5. Reflecting
6. Shadow (watch)
7. Researching
- Priorities
  - Seth best serves the team by learning code.
  - Sniper metaphor from Eli (Don't leave the rooftop)
- Language
  - C# constructor is a method named after the class
  - Generic type parameters `class Inventory<T>` allows your class to receive a variety
  of objects of any kind. The type is specified at (compile time???).
  - `List<T>` is a generic class which is a collection of elements of various types.
  It offers handy methods like `Add`, `Remove`, `Sort` and also implements some interfaces
  like `IEnumerable<T>`, `ICollection<T>`, and `IList<T>`.
  - Pascal case for method and class names. Camel for parameters and variables.
- Process
  - Tech Design EVERY PROBLEM before sitting down to code.
  - Diagram
- Pattern
  - [Lots of Learning Here](https://github.com/lampo/ramsey-plus-budget-app/pull/2479/files)
  

## June 5 - 9
- Team
  - We need to spend more time together doing:
    - Decomp
    - Talking about state management in Xamarin
- Data
  - Access local storage and reset it: https://github.com/lampo/ramsey-plus-learn-app/pull/2078/files
- Environment
  - Download new Xcode version (cuz emulator was messed up)
  - Point IDE to Xcode and point Xcode to a correct version of its own app.
- Xamarin
  - Recognize and distinguish View and ViewModel code and articulate the purpose for each. Articulate a code-behind.

## May 30 - June 2
- Maui
  - Front end library stuff
  - Data Binding in XAML can two-way (view<->model) or one way (view<-model), but Maui can detect this so it doesn't need to be manually set.
  - Network calls.
  - Platform APIs (battery, notifications, keyboard)
  - Navigation using the Shell
  - `ResourceDictionary` and `SetterProperty` make styling standard across the app.
  - `OnPlatform` can assign custom styles based on the platform it is implemented on.
- A bunch of other minutiae that that I didn't capture (especially about setting up a machine and an IDE).

## May 22 - 26
- Dev environment
  - It's important to document dev env setup.
- Design Patterns
  - Confidently evaluate the implementation of a Decorator pattern.
  - Confidently whiteboard a Decorator pattern.
  - Confidently refactor a decorator pattern.

## May 15 - 19

- Design Patterns
  - Confidently explain 
- Languages
  - Awareness of some of C#'s distinguishing characteristics
    - Strongly typed language
    - OOP
    - .Net is a framework which can compile many different languages (including and primarily C#) for use on a variety of platforms such as Windows, Linux, and MacOS)
    - overflow as an issue
    - variables can be set inside a function and passed back up through the argument and used outside a the function
```
static void ReturnVariable(int parameter, out int variable)
{
  variable = parameter + 100
}

static void Call()
{
  int variable;
  ReturnVariable(900, variable)
  Console.Write("variable is now {0}", variable)
}

Call() => variable is now 1,000
```
  Even though `ReturnVarialbe` is `void` (meaning it returns nothing),
  the variable can be set within itself and is passed back out.


## May 8 - 12
- Testing
  - Confidently find existing stubs and apply them as needed. _Hello_ `stub_debt_snowball`.
  - Confidently explain that stubs allow us to fake a response from an external API. 
  - Confidently use and explain what Capybara allows us to do (simulate a user interacting with a rendered component)
  - Confidently get annoyed with Capybara not providing a way to see why a `.has_text` test failed üòÜ
    - Throwing in a `binding.pry` helps.
  - Confidently interact with features hidden behind flags and 1:1 Coaching.
    - Enable/disable proper flag
    - `app/models/product_variant/base.rb`
      ```
      def can_access_one_on_one_coaching?
        # !!Current.coaching_organization.max_bookings.nonzero?
        true
      end
      ```
- Design Patterns
  - Awareness of how a decorator adds functionality to an object by wrapping it to dynamically add methods.
  - Confidently know why our Baby Steps need to have a decorator build them! It helps to smooth out the nasties in our monkey patch.
- Refactoring
  - Confidently identify the need for a refactor of our `BabyStepGoalDecorator` and propose a feasible solution.

## May 1 - 5
- Data
  - Awareness of how to sus-out the data I need using existing features.
  - Awareness that sometimes objects contain methods that aren't easy to find. 
  - Factory to build our BabyStep classes out into their own thing.
- Testing
  - Confidently articulate Arrange, Act, Assert
  - Awareness of how and why to stub data for network calls.
  - Awareness of different [RSpec expectations](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-expectations) 
- OOP
  - Awareness that Ruby's seemingly "typed" language is actually a facade. Exampe, `String` type is actually just a class that can be modified like any other.
  - Awareness that this means, our Ruby apps are essentially programming languages in themselves.
- Patterns
  - Monkey Patch. We bring an SDK/gem in, but redefine some of its methods in our app. Sharp knives...generally a bad idea. Best idea is to patch the SDK and bump the version so all the world can share.

  - Assignment operator `=` can be used in an `if` conditional to assign or else evaluate falsy.
  - Combine these two
    - `if (object = other_object.presence) { object }` returns the newly assigned object or else evaluates falsy.

## April 10 - 14
